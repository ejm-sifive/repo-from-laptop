Power Dial (formerly DDPM)
==========================

Caboose : unimplemented

Purpose
-------
The Power Dial feature provides a method of scaling down power use in a core without the need for voltage and frequency changes.

Method
------
The following 4b Register defines a series of reduced performance modes to scale power below the normal peak.

Addr : 0x7c8
Name : PowerDial
Reset: 0x0 

 MSB:4 RAWL ? 
 3:0  Instruction Issue Rate (% of peak)
+---+------------------+
| 0 | disabled  100%   |
+---+------------------+
| 1 | 1/15th    93.3%  |
+---+------------------+
| 15| 14/15th    6.7%  |
+---+------------------+

Description:
------------
When written to a non-zero value, the register causes instruction issue rates per-256-cycle periods to scale in the percentages shown to reduce relative power use.  Power is a function of many variables including voltage, frequency, pipeline execution and data, therefore the PowerDial register is only one element of a power management solution.
